        -Using the library keypad.h got to get the matrix already done for me as i have a 4x4 keypad too.
        -using a bunch of code from  http://www.retrobuiltgames.com/the-build-page/macro-keyboard-v2-0/ ,with deleated functionality to make it easier to understand  <br> just left the cases fro different macros programmed.
        -planning to modify the code to run on the stm32 as the pins and frequensys are different, but when i make progress at it i'll share it.
      </ul> 
      <ul>
         -just to give some unasked context as tried doing this same project when i had 16 some years ago, and had no real understanding(nor quality code to steal).  <br>But as i felt motivated to start doing some real coding instead of just watching tutorials all the time. thought that finishing this would be nice, and usefull for coding shortcuts.
         -It's my first time using git and git-hub so i'm sorry if i don't get to make proper commits.
         -Also not sure if citations are ok and how i refer to external code is ok so gonna try to work on that as the project evolves.
