<h1> Stm32-f1 Macro keypad</h1>
  <h3>Progress?</h3>  
   <ul>
     -Using the library keypad.h got to get the matrix already done for me as i have a 4x4 keypad too.<br><br>
     -using a bunch of code from  http://www.retrobuiltgames.com/the-build-page/macro-keyboard-v2-0/ ,with deleated functionality to make it easier to understand 9just left the cases fro different macros programmed.<br><br>
     -planning to modify the code to run on the stm32 as the pins and frequensys are different, but when i make progress at it i'll share it.<br>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Sorry for the mistakes</h3>
      <ul>
         -just to give some unasked context as i had tried doing this same project some years ago, and had no real understanding(nor quality code to steal). But as i felt motivated to start 
           doing some real coding instead of just watching tutorials all the time. thought that finishing this would be nice, and usefull for coding shortcuts.<br><br>
         -It's my first time using git and git-hub so i'm sorry if i don't get to make proper commits.<br><br>
         -Also not sure if citations are ok and how i refer to external code is ok so gonna try to work on that as the project evolves.
        </ul>
